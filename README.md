# Web Development Project 9 - *Pokemon Vote*

Submitted by: **Charles Norris**

This web app: ** Pokémon Dashboard: Your Interactive Pokémon Explorer

This React app lets you dive into the world of Pokémon with a sleek, data-driven dashboard. Browse through hundreds of Pokémon, filter them by type (like Fire or Water), and narrow your search using stats like HP or Attack power.

The dashboard shows you cool insights in real-time - which Pokémon has the highest HP, who's got the strongest attack, and how many of each type exist in your current view. The clean interface makes it super easy to explore, with instant search and responsive filters.

As you browse, the app intelligently loads more Pokémon data when needed, with smooth pagination to navigate through your results. Whether you're a casual fan or a competitive trainer analyzing stats, this dashboard puts all the Pokémon data you need at your fingertips!**
